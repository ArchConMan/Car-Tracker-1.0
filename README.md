# Car-Tracker-1.0
Learn how to make use of the GNSS capabilities of the [LinkIt ONE development board](http://labs.mediatek.com/oneguide) to acquire the position and the speed of a car. Tracking functionality is provided by uploading location data to the MediaTek Cloud Sandbox [(MCS)](http://labs.mediatek.com/mcs) using a GPRS connection, where the carâ€™s location can be displayed on a map. A bonus feature is the addition of an accelerometer that collects data on the g-forces generated by the car. 

An Arduino sketch is implemented, verified and uploaded to the LinkIt ONE development board. 

For the accelerometer operation download the [ADXL-345 driver](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Accelerometer_ADXL345).  

The HTTP communication is supported by an [HTTPClient driver](https://github.com/amcewen/HttpClient/releases).
